# This AcquireAndDisplay.py shows how to get the image data, and then display images in a GUI.
# This example relies on information provided in the ImageChannelStatistics.py example.
#
# This example demonstrates how to display images represented as numpy arrays.
# Currently, this program is limited to single camera use.
# NOTE: keyboard and matplotlib must be installed on Python interpreter prior to running this example.
